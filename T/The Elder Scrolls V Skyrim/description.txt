The .ini is based on ECLIPSE00074 settings, now adapted to modern OC, modding in Skyrim can be tricky I won't give support, advice about how mix the .ini with other mods. 
WARNING: Mods can break saves if you don't know what are you doing, example if you try this mod on top of another running mod, you are responsible for the use of this .ini,
